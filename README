Zebrafish Annotation

# 3 Datasets
Clarkson: N3 experiment of 3 replicates with 8 samples each, and the respective for the wild type.
Penn_Dev: B2 experiment of 3 replicates with 8 samples each.

STEP 1: convert raw to mgf with msconvert tool
STEP 2: search in mascot (search each dataset by each replicate and by all replicates, so 4 searches per dataset)
STEP 3: serial conversion of dats to csvs (ruby script on mascot server)

Penn Dev:
STEP 4: create a peptide list with the highest scored, phospho modified peptides of the Penn Dev combined search (T1,T2,T3)
		# Applied filters for step 4
		1) get all peptides "Phospho" modified => pep_var_mod
		2) unique highest scored peptides => pep_score
		3) only keep rank 1 peptides => pep_rank
		4) have expectancy cutoff => pep_expect
		5) sort list by peptide score
STEP 5: create a protein list with the unique proteins

Clarkson:
STEP 6: create a protein list with the unique proteins in each experiment (N3, WT)
STEP 7: create a list with all proteins identified in each experiment, that don't overlap with the ones in the other experiment
STEP 8: create a list with the identified proteins that are common in these experiments and calculate the significant and total 'matched peptides' ratios and log ratios for the differential expression, using the matched peptides abundance. NOTE: In case there are 0 significant peptide matches, the log ratio is not calculated, leaving an empty cell.
