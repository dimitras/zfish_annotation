Zebrafish Annotation

# 3 Datasets
Clarkson: N3 experiment of 3 replicates with 8 samples each, and the respective for the wild type.
Penn_Dev: B2 experiment of 3 replicates with 8 samples each.

STEP 1: convert raw to mgf with msconvert tool
STEP 2: search in mascot (search each dataset by each replicate and by all replicates, so 4 searches per dataset)
STEP 3: serial conversion of dats to csvs (ruby script on mascot server)

Penn Dev:
STEP 4: create a peptide list with the highest scored, phospho modified peptides of the Penn Dev combined search (T1,T2,T3)
		# Applied filters for step 4
		1) get all peptides "Phospho" modified => pep_var_mod
		2) unique highest scored peptides => pep_score
		3) only keep rank 1 peptides => pep_rank
		4) have expectancy cutoff => pep_expect
		5) sort list by peptide score
STEP 5: create a protein list with the unique proteins

Clarkson:
STEP 6: create a protein list with the unique proteins
STEP 7: calculate the significant and total 'matched peptides' ratios and log ratios betwwen the N3 and WT sets
